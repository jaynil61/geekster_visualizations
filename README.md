This project provides a series of visualizations for analyzing stock prices of several banks, including BAC, C, GS, JPM, MS, and WFC. The visualizations include scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, pie charts, boxplots, violin plots, and histograms. The purpose of these visualizations is to gain insights into the stock price trends, relationships, and distributions across different banks.
